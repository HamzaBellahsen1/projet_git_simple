Hi Instructor , here are my answers :') 

1) Web development refers to the process of creating websites or web applications for the internet. Web development is essential because it enables the creation of interactive and dynamic websites that serve as platforms for communication, information sharing, and online services.
2) Yes, HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Its primary purpose in web development is to structure content on the web. HTML provides the basic building blocks for web pages, allowing developers to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other types of content.
3) Yes, CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used in web development to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements. CSS allows developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to web pages, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.
4) Yes, JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on websites. It allows developers to implement features such as form validation, animations, interactive maps, and real-time updates. JavaScript is crucial for building interactive websites because it runs in the user's browser, enabling a responsive and engaging user experience.
5) Yes, I have some knowledge of both. React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It lets developers create reusable components, which makes building and maintaining web apps more efficient. Node.js, on the other hand, allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It's great for building scalable network applications because it can handle many connections simultaneously.
6) I hope to develop skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js so I can create my own projects, contribute to exciting web applications, and possibly even work in a tech role where I can help others through technology.

Thank you üëè
